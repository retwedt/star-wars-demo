This multi-user chat app is a project from Course 4 Server-side Programming at CodeAbode.  Users can enter their name, view a list of all users in the chat room, and communicate in real time with each other!   This app takes advantage of several technologies:

-	[JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - a popular JS library built around simplifying code and maximizing compatibility
-	[Smooth Scroll](https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll) - a lightweight script to animate scrolling to anchor links.
-	[Socket.io](http://socket.io/) - a package for real-time communication using websockets and Node.js
