and  the star wars logo left padding/margin is a bit large
are the poster images hyperlinks to the current page?
oh and just flipped to landscape
the logo + the url bar take up about half the screen, so a lot of the text gets occluded
it could probably be shrunk, or maybe even omitted, when there isn't enough vertical real estate
